# Spring School on Computational Chemistry Basic QC hands-on



This repository contains hands-on tutorials designed for the Spring School on Computational Chemistry. The exercises use the TmoleX graphical user interface together with the TURBOMOLE engine running on Puhti.  **Note:** TURBOMOLE requires a license, which is available for academic users on CSC supercomputers.

## [Preparations](./preparations/README.md)

- Set up TmoleX either via a browser or by installing it on your own laptop.


## [Tutorial 1](./tutorial1/README.md)


- Use TmoleX to prepare a geometry optimization of a small molecule at the DFT level.
- Submit the job via TmoleX to Puhti, where the actual calculation is performed.
- Use TmoleX to monitor the progress of the job.
- Use TmoleX to retrieve and analyze the results.

## [Tutorial 2](./tutorial2/README.md)

- Perform multiple geometry optimizations of various isomers.
- Switch to a higher-quality basis set for a single-point energy calculation.
- Benchmark resource usage by analyzing job durations relative to the resources used.
- Construct your own job template and apply it to a set of molecules.
